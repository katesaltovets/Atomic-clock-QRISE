# Lehigh-QRISE
This is a project completed by the Lehigh Quantum Computing Club where we're breaking down the atomic clock algorithm on a quantum computer, using the outline from [Marciniak et. al, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04435-4) paper proposed by Infleqtion during QRISE 2024. 
### Overview
For our project working on the Infleqtion research challenge, we were tasked with implementing quantum algorithms to reach the fundamental limits of precision when it comes to metrology. As the paper describes, this is achieved by utilizing a variational quantum Ramsey interferometry circuit, which is essentially the well-known Ramsey sequence for determining frequencies in addition to entangling and decoding unitaries before and after the z rotation with angle 𝝓, respectively. As a result of this sequence, we will be able to obtain a probability of the distribution results given an angle of 𝝓, which will, in turn, allow us to make an estimate on what angle was imparted on the system and subsequently calculate the mean squared error (MSE) between the known and estimated angles. From here we can construct the cost function as the averaged MSE over all values of 𝝓 that can be minimized to give us more optimal twisting parameters to use in the next iteration of the algorithm. While the paper went further and explored methods for self-calibration, we stuck with the manual optimization of parameters. Once these parameters have been gotten, we adjust the unitaries to reflect the change and run another iteration of the algorithm. To track the precision of the estimation, the paper makes use of the ratio between the knowledge of 𝝓 before measurement, 𝛅𝝓, and knowledge of 𝝓 after the measurement, 𝚫𝝓, or the ratio 𝚫𝝓/𝛅𝝓. Since we’re seeking to have precise estimates of our angle 𝝓, we would then want to make sure that this ratio is minimized as much as possible.

In our code, we set our initial twisting parameters to 𝝅/4 and 𝝅/3, respectively. We also were looking to reproduce the results that the paper had, so based off of their figures we chose our 𝝓 = 𝝅/4 and our J_z = 2 (although we weren’t confident about this number or where we should be pulling it from).
